<br />
I have chosen to use three of my past projects to work with
<br />
Cats ~ The first time working with HTML.
Lists ~ Starting to use CSS.
Memory ~ Getting use to JS.
<br />
I had to create new folders inside this project in order to get the code to work.
There should be 2 of each card. I did that so i could see that both were working and pulling the same info.
<br />
The section using the map() method has the added ' target="-blank" ' to ensure both methods work
<br />
Had to change the names for the Cats, Lists and Memory .js and .css files.
